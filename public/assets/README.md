   - Should be the sunny/green garden background
   - Recommended: 780px × 1688px (2x) or higher

2. **bg-cloud.png** - Animated cloud layer (middle layer)
   - Cloud that will move across the screen
   - Should have transparent background
   - Recommended: Same dimensions or slightly larger for seamless looping

3. **mushroom-house.png** - Mushroom house (top layer, static)
   - The gnome's mushroom house
   - Should have transparent background

## File Naming:
- Keep the exact filenames as listed above
- Use PNG format for transparency support
- Optimize file sizes for web (use tools like TinyPNG)

## Green Color:
The green color from your background image will be used for seamless extension if content overflows. The default is `#6B8E23` but you can adjust it in `AnimatedBackground.tsx` if needed.
